# Actuarial-Pricing-Model---GI-Pricing
Built an end-to-end actuarial pricing model for a General Insurance portfolio using a frequency–severity approach. Modeled claim frequency with Poisson and severity with Lognormal distributions, applied Monte Carlo simulation to capture loss volatility, and derived a risk-adjusted technical premium including expenses and profit loading.
